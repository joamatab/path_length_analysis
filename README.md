## Introduction

In the realm of electronic design and integrated circuit (IC) development, understanding the intricacies of signal paths is paramount. To streamline this process, we introduce our powerful tool ‚Äì the Path Length Report Generator tailored for GDS files.

The Path Length Report Generator is a specialized utility designed for analyzing and reporting on signal path lengths within GDS files.

In a world where precision and efficiency are paramount, our Path Length Report Generator empowers designers and engineers to elevate their electronic designs to new heights. Dive into the intricacies of your GDS files and pave the way for enhanced performance in your designs.

## Current-Status

> :warning: We are currently treating the current content as an **experimental preview!**

The tool will be tagged with a production version when ready to do.

## Prerequisites

At a minimum:

- python 3.9+
- python3-venv


To install a virtual environment for ubuntu 22.04:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# OR
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
```


## Installation

To install the path length environment, run the following commands in your command-line prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mabrains/Path_Length.git
cd Path_Length/

python3 -m venv ./path_length_env
source ./path_length_env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The configuration.yaml file should include the following.

*   gds file path
*   top cell name if more than cell available
*   path layer as tuple of two integers for layer number and dtype.
*   cutting layer as tuple of two integers for layer number and dtype.
*   nodes of interest to filter path report by as a list of strings corresponding to text placed on cutting polygons. if not included all nodes are considered.

configuration file example
```yaml
gds_file: path_to_file.gds
cell_name: top_cell
path_layer: 
- 1
- 0
cutting_layer:
- 2
- 0
nodes: 
- starting_node
- intermediate_node
- end_node
```
The `path_length.py` script takes your configuration file to run path length analysis on gds file. 

```bash
    python3 path_length.py (--help| -h)
    python3 path_length.py (--config=<config_file_path>) [--run_dir=<run_dir_path>]
```

Example:

```bash
    python3 path_length.py --config=gds_examples/test.gds --run_dir=path_length_results
```

### Options

- `--help -h`                           Print this help message.

- `--config=<config_file_path>`                  Yaml file contains the configuration needed for path length analysis parameters.
- `--run_dir=<run_dir_path>`                  Run directory to save all the results [default: pwd].
